---++ Usage

This extensions applies a "hotfix" for Item11983 to your Foswiki 1.1.5 or 1.1.6 system. 

<blockquote>
<div class="foswikiAlert">%X% *CAUTION:* This patch can significantly improve the performance of the Foswiki "Store" system by reducing calls to the "RCS" -
Revision Control System.  However it removes critical checks that are performed to detect topics that have been externally modified outside of
Foswiki.  *This fix is not recommended if you have topics will be, or have been modified externally.*   This includes:
<ul><li>Topic.txt files manually edited without updating the =%META:TOPICINFO= line, and without checking them into RCS.
<li>Topic.txt files that are created or modified by external processes.
</ul> </div>
</blockquote>

When this extension is installed, it uses the Post-installation exit to apply any patch files found in the manifest.  This extension ships with a hotfix for the following items:

| *Original Issue* | *Patch File* | *Description* |
| [[http://foswiki.org/Tasks/Item11983][Item11983]] | =Item11983-001= | Reduce calls to RCS made by Store to verify the TOPICINFO information. |

Before any file is patched, a backup is copied to =working/configure/backup/&lt;Item11983-001-date-time&gt;=. Each file that is a candidate to be patched is backed up.  If the extensions is installed multple times, a new backup is made for each run, regardless of whether or not the patch will be applied.  For this patch, the following files are copied:
   * =lib/Foswiki/Store/VC/Store.pm=
   * =lib/Foswiki/Store/VC/Handler.pm=

Patches are only applied if the target file is an _exact_ match to the original file.  There is no attempt to do "fuzzy" patching.   Note however that a patch can be built to cover multiple versions of the file.

There is no "dependency order" established between patches.  Patches are installed in order of their patch file name.

Patches will be mapped from the default Foswiki filename to the directory location used on the target system.
